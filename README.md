# tribute-page
This is a project on freeCodeCamp to test your responsive web design skills. 

You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and 
you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose.
